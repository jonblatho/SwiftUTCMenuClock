# SwiftUTCMenuClock
A simple menu bar app for macOS that shows the current time in UTC. Loosely inspired by [UTCMenuClock](https://github.com/netik/UTCMenuClock) but rewritten from scratch in Swift.

Requires macOS Catalina or later.

## Installation
Installing SwiftUTCMenuClock is easy:

1. Head to the [latest release](https://github.com/jonblatho/SwiftUTCMenuClock/releases/latest) and download **SwiftUTCMenuClock.app.zip**.
2. Extract the ZIP archive. (This might be done automatically.)
3. Drag **SwiftUTCMenuClock.app** from wherever it downloaded to to your Applications folder.
4. Open it!

By default, SwiftUTCMenuClock will open itself at login going forward. (You can disable that by clicking on the menu clock and selecting the relevant option.)
